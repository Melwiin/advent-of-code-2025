# 🎄 Advent of Code -- Rust Edition

Welcome to my cozy little Advent of Code project!\
Every day has its own Rust file, its own puzzle, and its own tiny
victory. ✨

## 🗂 Project Structure

    src/
     ├── main.rs        # selects which day to run
     └── days/          # one file per day!
          ├── day01.rs
          ├── day02.rs
          └── ...

## ▶️ How to Run

Pick a day and run:

``` bash
cargo run -- <day>
```

Example:

``` bash
cargo run -- 3
```

## 🎁 Happy coding & happy holidays!

May your borrow checker be kind and your puzzles solvable. ❤️
